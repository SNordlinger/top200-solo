Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> entry
Rule 1     entry -> NUMBER part
Rule 2     part -> TITLE
Rule 3     part -> part PARENTHETICAL

Terminals, with rules where they appear

NUMBER               : 1
PARENTHETICAL        : 3
TITLE                : 2
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

entry                : 0
part                 : 1 3

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . entry
    (1) entry -> . NUMBER part

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 2

    entry                          shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> entry .



state 2

    (1) entry -> NUMBER . part
    (2) part -> . TITLE
    (3) part -> . part PARENTHETICAL

    TITLE           shift and go to state 4

    part                           shift and go to state 3

state 3

    (1) entry -> NUMBER part .
    (3) part -> part . PARENTHETICAL

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (entry -> NUMBER part .)
    PARENTHETICAL   shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (2) part -> TITLE .

    PARENTHETICAL   reduce using rule 2 (part -> TITLE .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (part -> TITLE .)


state 5

    (3) part -> part PARENTHETICAL .

    PARENTHETICAL   reduce using rule 3 (part -> part PARENTHETICAL .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (part -> part PARENTHETICAL .)
